# 🎨 Skribble – Real-Time Multiplayer Draw & Guess Game
Project Description...
A full-stack multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by **skribbl.io**, built using **React, Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO**.

Players can create public or private rooms, draw words in real time, guess drawings, earn points, and compete on a live leaderboard. The application supports spectators, custom word lists, multiple word modes, replay functionality, moderation tools, and seamless real-time synchronization across all connected clients.

## ⚡ Real-Time Features

### Drawing Synchronization

Drawing strokes are transmitted through Socket.IO events and rendered on all connected clients instantly.

### Canvas Replay

Every drawing stroke is stored and can be replayed at the end of a round.

### Late Join Synchronization

New players receive the complete stroke history and reconstruct the current canvas automatically.

### Hint System

Letters are progressively revealed during the round to help players guess the word.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Render

1. Push repository to GitHub
2. Create a new Render Web Service
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy backend
5. Deploy frontend
6. Update `VITE_SERVER_URL`

### Railway

## 🔐 Engineering Decisions

### Why Socket.IO?

Socket.IO provides:

* Low latency communication
* Automatic reconnection
* Room support
* Event-based architecture

### Why Store Strokes Instead of Images?

Benefits:

* Lower bandwidth usage
* Replay support
* Undo support
* Late join synchronization

### Why OOP Architecture?

Benefits:

* Better code organization
* Easier maintenance
* Improved scalability
* Clear separation of responsibilities
